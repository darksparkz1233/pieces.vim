# pieces.vim
![](./humora.jpg)

Vim color scheme. White text on a black background. No syntax highlighting.

I don't like extravagant and useless things, so I removed the code highlighting. As for why I used purple to mark strings, numbers, and why the name of this theme is pieces.
Because of Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

## Installation

Use the Vim package manager of your choice.
Like this
```
call plug#begin()
Plug 'Miraboreas/pieces.vim'
call plug#end()

colorscheme abyss
```
